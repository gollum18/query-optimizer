# query-optimizer
Implements a simple query optimizer in a project for CIS 611: Enterprise DB &amp; Parallel Database Systems

## What is this?
This repository houses a semester project I was assigned for CIS 611: Enterprise DB &amp; Parallal Database Systems at CSU. 
This project implements a simple query optimizer that given an unoptimized query and a supposedly optimized query attempts to determine the best execution plan based on well known metrics generated for each observed relational operator.
